# OS2 Project Journey

This document aggregates the OS2 microkernel journey in a single place. The work log, roadmap, and task lists all converge here so that newcomers can quickly understand past iterations and the commands that shaped them.

## Journey at a Glance
- **Founding vision:** Build a deterministic, capability-driven AI microkernel that lets agents experiment safely.
- **Community-first:** The codebase evolves as a hobby project supported by Codex contributions. Participation in the community is always free—no memberships or fees.
- **Observability:** Every phase is verified through hash-chained ledgers, snapshots, and replay tooling.

## Phase Chronology
### Phase 0 – Environment Pivot
- [x] F0.1 Selected the Python-based shell as the single controlled workspace.
- [x] F0.2 Archived legacy hypervisor remnants and simplified the development environment.
- [x] F0.3 Locked the new baseline with `environment_pivot_complete` events.

### Phase 1 – Deterministic Kernel Foundations
- [x] F1.1 Established atomic operation ordering via the snapshot ledger.
- [x] F1.2 Strengthened the `TokenSignatureLedger` hash chain and added automatic integrity checks.
- [x] F1.3 Made the I/O queue deterministic, enabling replay support.

### Phase 2 – Python VM Integration
- [x] F2.1 Enabled sandboxed execution for `pyvm`, `python`, `pyx`, and `pip` commands with streaming output.
- [x] F2.2 Recorded token budgets, snapshot tags, and manifest-controlled imports in the ledger for every session.
- [x] F2.3 Completed the async queue, environment provisioning (`create-env`), and entropy logging.

### Phase 3 – Deterministic AI Execution
- [x] F3.1 Logged model calls with snapshot and token identifiers.
- [x] F3.2 Tied GPU access to capability policies and tracked seed/entropy records.
- [x] F3.3 Extended replay and rollback flows to cover AI workloads.

### Phase 4 – Autonomous Task Management
- [x] F4.1 Added the `self_task_review` module to deterministically govern external API permissions.
- [x] F4.2 Logged resource governance, automated task suggestions, and self-review loops to the ledger.

### Phase 5 – Security Hardening
- [x] F5.1 Completed module signing, the GPU access layer, and `module_permission_updated` events.
- [x] F5.2 Stored snapshot backups with signatures and scheduled regular entropy audits.

### Phase 6 – Deterministic Verification
- [x] F6.1 Verified 1000+ replay runs with `python_vm_replay_verified` and `deterministic_benchmark_completed` events.
- [x] F6.2 Recorded command logs (`python-verify`, `deterministic-benchmark`) in the ledger.

### Phase 7 – Documentation and Release
- [x] F7.1 Produced the shell handbook, release workflow, and module tree documentation.
- [x] F7.2 Marked the kernel ready for the next evolution stage with `kernel_ready_flag_updated`.

## Highlight Commands
| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `python sample.py` | Run interactive scripts inside the sandbox with live output streaming. |
| `pip install <package>` | Install packages through the deterministic pip client and log the activity. |
| `git clone <repo>` | Clone safely from the shell with progress reporting and interrupt handling. |
| `snapshot-auth <id>` | Authenticate against the snapshot ledger and mint a fresh token. |
| `python-verify --json` | Replay recorded Python sessions and compare them against the ledger. |
| `deterministic-benchmark run --count 5` | Execute the deterministic benchmark suite and collect summary metrics. |
| `self-task-review --json list` | Enumerate external provider permissions through the governed API. |

## What Comes Next
- Gather community feedback to shape Phase 8 tasks.
- Recruit volunteers to experiment with multi-node replication and automated environment provisioning.
- Open a Discord/Matrix channel once enough interested developers raise their hands.
